### DeepTrio: a ternary prediction system for proteinâ€“protein interaction using mask multiple parallel convolutional neural networks

## Motivation
Protein-protein interaction (PPI), as a relative property, depends on two binding proteins of it, which brings a great challenge to design an expert model with unbiased learning and superior generalization performance. Additionally, few efforts have been made to grant models discriminative insights on relative properties.

# Run DeepTrio for training

To run DeepSol on your own training data you need to prepare the following two things:

  1. Protein-protein Interaction File: A pure protein ID file, in which two protein IDs are separated by the Tab key, alonge with their label (1 for 'interacting', 0 for 'non-interacting' and 2 for 'single protein'). We provide
  2. Protein Sequence Database File: A file containing protein IDs and their sequences.

# Run DeepTrio for prediction

# Installation

It is recommended to install dependencies in conda virtual environment so that only few installation commands are required for running DeepTrio. 
You can prepare all the dependencies just by the following commands.

  - Install Miniconda

    Miniconda is a free minimal installer for conda. It is a small, bootstrap version of Anaconda that includes only conda, Python, the packages they depend on, and a small number of other useful packages, including pip, zlib and a few others

    1. Download Miniconda installer for linux : https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#linux-installers
    2. Check the hashes for the Miniconda from : https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda_hashes.html
    3. Go to the installation directory and run command : `bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh`

  - Creating the environment

    If there is no environment in your Miniconda environment, it is recommeneded to create a new environment to run DeepTrio.

    1. Run `conda create -n [your env name] python=3.7`
    2. Run `conda activate [your env name]`
    3. Run `conda install tensorflow-gpu==2.1`
    4. Run `conda install seaborn`
    5. Run `conda install -c conda-forge scikit-learn`
    6. Run `conda install -c conda-forge gpyopt`
    7. Run `conda install -c conda-forge dotmap`
