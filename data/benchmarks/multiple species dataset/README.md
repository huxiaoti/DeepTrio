## Multiple species dataset

This dataset is derived from Celegan, Drosophila and Ecoli, and the proteins inside are excluded based on different thresholds of sequence identity. This dataset is used to test the model's performance under stringent criteria of sequence identity between training and testing in PIPR (doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btz328).
